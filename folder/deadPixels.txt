# Some time ago, my camera decided is was time to show a single dead pixel right at the center of the screen. 
#
# I was annoyed.
#
# Below these commented lines (#) you can place a list of dead pixels in the following format.
#
# USETHIS
# X1 Y2
# X2 Y2
# X..Y..
#
# The data of each pixel at these coordinates will be ignored.
# If the first non-commented word in the following file says 'USETHIS' (case-insensitive, without the ' characters), 
# the lines below will be parsed. The lines contain an X and Y coordinate seperated by a single space. Empty 
# lines are ignored, only lines containing two positive integer values are parsed. 
# A maximum of 1000 dead-pixels are supported.
#
# Remember that it's not wise to use the dead pixel list on cropped videos, as the dead-pixels won't be in the same location for each frame!
